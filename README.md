Build a bot to grow your Instagram account's following by automatically following prospective user and expecting a follow-back
In this project you will build an instagram bot with Python. The goal of the project is to use Python to help small business accounts grow their following by idetifying prospective followers, following them and expecting them to follow you back. After a while you will also unfollow those who do not follow you back automatically to maintain the integrity of your account.

How to identify prospective followers
Users most likely to follow your account are users who are already engaged in your competitor's instagram account or those engaging in posts in your industry hashtags. Example: if I have a new business selling socks, call it Sockses, I will find followers by going to DapperMonkey's instagram account (my competitor) and follow userrs who like their posts (these are the most engaged and most likely the ones who would be interested in following my business to learn more about socks). Alternatively, I will go t hashtags such as #happysocks and follow users who have liked the posts. After 7 days I will clean up my account by unfollowing users who did not follow me back. Gradually, my audience wil grow and hopefully my business will start thriving on Instagram.

Using Python to build an Instagram bot
First, this project will require that you get familiar with Selenium, one of the most interesting Python libraries used for browser automation. This will allow you to access your account and automate browser actions remotely using your Python code to effect the goals for this project. Learn more about Selenium by visiting their official documentation.

Second, Instagram is always actively looking to eliminate bots from their platform and they constantly look to find activity that resembles that of bots. Therefore, we recommend you use a test account when working on your project. We also recommend that you randomise pretty much any task your bot undertakes to make it less identifiable. This includes the the intervals at which you follow users, how many users you follow at any given time and even how fast you make follow/unfollow clicks cause humans can not be ass fast as bots. Essentially randomise everything if you want your bot to survive.

Finaly, feel free to learn from public resources i.e. blogs and YouTube videos on how to build bots with Selenium. This will give you a solid base of ideas on how to implement this project.

Note that this is a challenging project but no learning happens if you don't take up a huge challenge. You could also get small businesses to use your bot and hopefully make some bucks if it actually works. Focus on making it work first.
